1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,638
Essentially, loan the government 100,000 pounds each and hundred

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:07,102
billion pounds collectively. And in return, the government

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:10,646
would guarantee that after ten years or 20 years, it will return this

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,382
money with a 3% interest. Now, what have we learned from the previous episode?

5
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:17,814
The longer you keep this money in the garment, the more interest they'll pay you.

6
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:21,270
For example, a two year bond could pay you a 3% interest, and a ten

7
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:24,366
year bond could pay you a 7% interest. So just like

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,956
in the previous episode, the demand supply forces will come in. But this

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,932
time the primary focus is not the yield curve,

10
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:34,812
but the cost of borrowing of the government. So let's try

11
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:38,076
to understand this using a simple example. So let's say there is a ten year

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,724
bond that is being sold at 100 pounds per unit at an interest rate of

13
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:45,036
3%. So if you invest 100 pounds in a ten year bond,

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,596
you would get three pounds as interest. Now, listen to this very,

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,860
very carefully. Now, if there is nobody willing to

16
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:54,954
buy these ten year units from the government at hundred pounds,

17
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:58,718
what will the government do? They would decrease the price of the unit to

18
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:02,334
90 pounds. So if Shubham bought this unit at 90 pounds,

19
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:06,118
he would still get three pounds in return. Which means back then,

20
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:10,238
the garment was borrowing 100 pounds at 3% interest, but now

21
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:14,526
they are borrowing just 90 pounds at 3.33% interest.

22
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,646
And in spite of this cost drop, if still people don't want to buy these

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,154
units or there is an oversupply of these bonds in the market,

24
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:25,426
the unit price will drop further to 60 pounds, which means now

25
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,426
the government is borrowing 60 pounds at a 5% interest.

26
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,026
So you see, because of the demand supply mismatch, the government is

27
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,330
getting less money from the people at a very, very high

28
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:39,794
interest rate. And this is a very, very dangerous position for

29
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:43,898
any government where the interest of the bonds are climbing so high. This is

30
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:47,026
the reason why the ten year bond rates in the UK have gone up by

31
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,448
almost 300%, going from just above 1% to 4.11%

32
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:54,876
in just nine months. Now, most people would say, yeah,

33
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,980
bro, so what? The government bonds are now giving out 4% interest, which is absolutely

34
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:02,916
crazy. So everyone will flock to buy these bonds and the interest rates

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,876
will go down, right? So what exactly is the problem? Well,

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,284
guess what? Here's where the UK has another problem in the form

37
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:13,932
of currency depreciation, which makes the bond market of UK

38
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:17,460
almost useless for big traders. And this is where we have the

39
00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:20,888
currency carry trade that we spoke about in the previous episode. But in

40
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:24,680
the previous episode, we spoke about the impact of the feds hiking

41
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:27,944
the interest rate on the currency carry trade. But this time,

42
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,736
let's have a look at what will currency depreciation do to the currency carry

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,328
trade. So, let's say William is a billionaire who wants to make money using currency

44
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:38,264
carry trade in the UK. So what would he do? Firstly,

45
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:41,720
he would check the lending rates in the US and check the bond market rates

46
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:45,328
in the UK. So if the US bank is lending at 2% and

47
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:48,886
the UK bonds are yielding 4%, William will decide to enter the

48
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,494
market. So, firstly, he would borrow $1 million from the US bank.

49
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,454
Secondly, he would convert this $1 million into pounds.

50
00:02:55,574 --> 00:03:00,102
Now, had he made this conversion in January, this would amount to 714,000

51
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,390
pounds. Considering 1.4 to be exchange rate, then he would invest

52
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:07,862
these 714,000 pounds in the UK bonds and leave

53
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,302
it there for a year. Then, after one year, had it been a normal market,

54
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:14,980
he would get his 714,000 pounds with a full interest,

55
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:18,332
which amounts to 742,560 pounds.

56
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:22,444
Now, he would convert this amount to dollars, which would amount to $1.04

57
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:26,244
million. So if you look at the interest rate of the feds, he just

58
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:30,380
has to pay 2% interest to the american bank, as in $1.02 million.

59
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:34,900
So out of the $1.04 million that he has, he just has to pay 1.02

60
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:38,388
million and the rest, 0.02 million, will be his profit.

61
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:41,806
So you see, by simply rotating this money, William was able to

62
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,142
make two in profit. But like I said,

63
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:48,606
this is the ideal condition. But today, if you look at the market in

64
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,750
UK, the value of pound has depreciated by almost 21.4%

65
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:56,454
since January. So now the exchange rate is just 1.1.

66
00:03:56,614 --> 00:04:01,174
Now, let's see what happens after one year when William gets 742,560

67
00:04:01,214 --> 00:04:05,142
pounds. When he converts that to dollars, at an exchange rate of 1.1,

68
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,680
he would get only $816,000. But since

69
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:12,736
the american bank is leaving a 2% interest, he still has to pay 1.02

70
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,336
million to the american bank. Which means what? Even though the bonds are

71
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,912
giving out a 4% interest, because the currency has depreciated

72
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:23,496
by 21.4%, this currency carry trade has become a

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,712
disaster for William. This is what is exactly happening

74
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,992
in the UK, whereby even though the bonds are yielding a 4%

75
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,544
interest, the currency has depreciated to such an extent that

76
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:36,808
now it has become a disaster for the investors. As a result,

77
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:40,856
they are quitting the UK market, and this is further decreasing the

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,464
demand for pounds. As a result, the currency is depreciating further.

79
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:48,384
So now that the pound is depreciating, what will happen? The energy prices will

80
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:51,592
not just spike because of the gas shortage. They will not just spike

81
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:55,168
because of peak consumption levels during winter, but also because of

82
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:58,984
currency depreciation. And this will take the cost of energy in the UK to

83
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:02,464
dangerous levels. And when these energy bills spike up, what will happen?

84
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:06,360
The government of UK will have to borrow more money in order to compensate for

85
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:09,600
these losses. Which means more bonds will float in the market,

86
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:13,512
which means the demand for the bonds will go down, and then the

87
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:17,472
interest of these bonds will go up, which means the cost of borrowing for

88
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:21,112
the garment will increase further, eventually depreciating the currency

89
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:24,432
further, and that will lead to a vicious cycle. On top

90
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:28,086
of that, they've also announced tax cuts which are expected to decrease the

91
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,622
government revenues by $45 billion till 2026.

92
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:35,798
So in short, the government of UK is cutting down its own revenues during

93
00:05:35,846 --> 00:05:39,102
a cash crunch situation. This is the reason why everybody is

94
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:42,166
scared that this scenario will spiral the entire economy

95
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,862
of UK into a freaking disaster. This is the reason why

96
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,470
the bank of England is now about to buy 65 billion pounds worth of

97
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:52,920
bonds, so that they could prevent the interest rates from falling.

98
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:56,420
And in the south, with housing loan spikes due to inflation and bank defaults,

99
00:05:56,532 --> 00:06:00,532
it will cause a banking and housing crisis along with energy and

100
00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:04,164
currency crisis. This is the story of the economic crisis

101
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:07,796
of the UK. So now UK has two options. One is to withdraw the sanctions,

102
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,996
get the gas from Russia and chill. Or secondly, deal with the

103
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,060
complications of its economy by being dependent on the US and hope

104
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:17,412
that they dont mess up. And this brings me to the most important part

105
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:20,948
of the episode and that are the study materials to help you understand this economic

106
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:24,156
crisis in the UK better. But before we move on,

107
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,908
I want to quickly thank our partners of this episode. And that is coding invaders,

108
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:31,556
people. The international markets have been free falling in the last few

109
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,252
weeks and in conditions like these, there's a high possibility of a job crisis.

110
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:38,820
But that's where coding invaders come in. They help you switch from non

111
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:41,900
IT profession to it for high paying jobs within six

112
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:46,404
to eight months. As a data analyst, their current placement stats stand at 93%.

113
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:49,542
And the best part is that before you enroll for the course, they provide you

114
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:53,254
with a guaranteed job agreement with a money back guarantee. So basically,

115
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:56,958
if you do not get placed, you will get a hundred percent refund.

116
00:06:57,086 --> 00:07:00,742
Their courses have real world business, case studies, job oriented projects

117
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:03,582
and assignments designed by industry experts from Amazon,

118
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:07,526
Phillips, Deloitte and others and even a civil engineer like me without

119
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,902
an IT background will be able to learn data science and be eligible for

120
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,382
a high paying IT jobs such as a data analyst. So you

121
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:17,828
don't need a coding background to get into such jobs. They have helped

122
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:21,188
20,000 candidates secure 1025 LPA packages in

123
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:24,780
the past 6.5 months itself with the help of their 300 hiring

124
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,916
partners. So this Diwali you can choose to invest in

125
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,156
yourself rather than the markets. So if this sounds

126
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,332
useful to you, click the link in the description and use the code TS 30

to get 30% fee discount in the job guarantee batch.

128
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,036
Moving on to the study materials, the first thing I am attaching is this 40

129
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,160
page report itself which will teach you about the mini budget. Read through it

130
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:48,352
and you will understand the other nuances of this crisis.

131
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,960
Secondly, I am attaching the nicer paper that will teach you about the economic

132
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,296
consequence of the energy policy. And I am also attaching a twitter thread

133
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,560
from Anshul who is the co founder of Wind wealth and he has explained the

134
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:02,400
UK bond crisis even more in depth with simple examples. And lastly,

135
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:06,080
I am attaching a think school video on the russian gas strategy to choke Europe.

136
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,928
Have a look at that and you will understand. Where did all this episode start

137
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:12,004
and what is the leverage that Russia has over Europe?

138
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:15,332
That's all from my side for today guys. If you learned something elaborate, please make
